# Detailed Game rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to form a line of three of your symbols ('X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid. Two players take turns, with Player 1 ('X') going first, and they alternate throughout the game. The game ends when a player successfully creates a line of three of their symbols, resulting in a win, or when the entire board is filled, leading to a draw. To play, select an empty cell on your turn and place your symbol, but make sure not to occupy a cell already taken. Strategize to block your opponent and aim for your own winning lines. Remember to enjoy the game and play fairly!
